<h2>MAKING THE RUNNING WITH "THE DERBY WINNER."</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Druriolanus</span> has scored another success. And why not? Surely he deserves
it, for, with the assistance of his two collaborators, <span class="smcap">Cecil Raleigh</span> and
<span class="smcap">Henry Hamilton</span>, Sir <span class="smcap">Augustus Harris</span> has trained a Derby winner that will
carry all before him over the Drury Lane course until the place is
required for the pantomime. And the training has been most judicious.
The problem the three stable companions (for the piece is nothing if not
horsey) set themselves was to produce a drama that would fill the Grand
National Theatre both before and behind the curtain. This problem they
have solved to the satisfaction of all parties.</p>

<div class="figcenter w80">
<a href="images/169a.png">
<img src="images/169a.png"
alt="" /></a>
<p class="center">"Three to One on."</p>
</div>

<p>The method adopted is simple enough. Take, for instance, the First Act.
One of the authors no doubt suggested the interior of a country house.
"Quite so," says <span class="smcap">Druriolanus</span>, "a nobleman's country house. I will show
you how to do it." And he does. "O <i>Todgers's</i> can do it when it likes!"
Gorgeous hall with a billiard table thrown in at the back to give an
idea of the luxury and magnitude. And then the company! Earls and
Countesses and Lords and Ladies and a Duchess! Why, even the villain is
a major in a crack cavalry regiment, and the low comedian a surgeon who
has worn the Queen's uniform. Apparently to give the latter additional
aristocratic gloss, the Duchess is made to be in love with him. And the
plot? Why, of course. Let Miss <span class="smcap">Alma Stanley</span> arrive direct from India to
sow discord between my Lord the hero and my Lady the heroine. This she
does, looking charming in her villainy, and wearing a striking costume.
My Lord tells her "to begone" (a most unreasonable request, by the way,
as she has arrived at the Hall in the middle of the night, with
evidently any number of boxes), but she won't. Miss <span class="smcap">Alma Stanley</span> prefers
to faint in my Lord's arms, to the great indignation of my Lady. Tableau
and curtain.</p>

<p>Next, please. The Downs, and a trial of the 'osses. Then we have a meet
of horses, saddle and otherwise. The "otherwise" are harnessed to a
pony-chaise that looks as if it had come from the Lowther Arcade. Miss
<span class="smcap">Alma Stanley</span> rides in on a steed of her own. My Lord, the hero, objects
to the gracious presence of this fair equestrian, and gets a
horse-whipping for his trouble. Then the trial comes off. The noble
animals canter across the stage. The <i>dramatis person√¶</i> describe their
progress to one another as they make the running behind the scenes. All
first-rate and life-like. Haven't we seen it ourselves in the early
morn? Then they reappear (amidst immense enthusiasm) as cardboard
profile in the distance, to make a final entry in the horseflesh from
the O. P. wings. Capitally done, and a great success. Stalls, Circle,
Pit, Boxes, and Gallery, all delighted. So are they with the military
ball at York. Nearly everybody in uniform. Hussars, Gunners,
Highlanders, Fusileers, and Yeomen. My Lord the hero appears as Colonel
of his county Yeomanry. Quite right, he has left the service, and taken
to the reserve. Then there is the cotillion, and my Lord finds himself,
to his surprise, dancing with Miss <span class="smcap">Alma Stanley</span>. He is again caught by
my Lady, the heroine (the poor chap is always compromising himself at
the wrong moment), and there is of course only one solution to this
embarrassing situation, and that is,&mdash;curtain. No better ball scene been
on the stage for years. <span class="smcap">Druriolanus</span> has all the details at his
fingertips, and the ball at his feet. Keep it rolling!</p>

<p>In the next Act we find that the Countess, in full ball costume, has
eloped with the Villainous Major to a hotel. My Lady has allowed her
companion to describe themselves as Mr. and Mrs. So-and-So in the
porter's book. But thus far and no farther. When the Major politely begs
the loan of her heart, the Countess bids him go, and treats him really
with absolute rudeness. The Major, after a terrible struggle with my
Lady, in which he gets the worst of it, is completely crushed, and
probably inwardly laments the very considerable expense to which he must
have been put by the elopement. At this crisis enter my Lord the hero.
Row and tableau. After this, the audience feels that the correct
prescription is to cut the dialogue and come to the "'osses." And to a
great extent this prescription is adopted. There is a first-class scene
of a sale at Tattersall's, and a very realistic view of the finish at
the Derby. The throng cheer behind the curtain, and so does the throng
in front of it. The task is complete: both sides of the green baize are
crowded with excited people.</p>

<p>It is exceptionally good. Scenery, music, general stage management, and
incidental music all excellent. Mrs. <span class="smcap">John Wood</span> first-rate, as good as
ever, and Miss <span class="smcap">Alma Stanley</span> greatly distinguishes herself. So does Mr.
<span class="smcap">Cartwright</span> as the most matter-of-fact villain that "in this distressful
country has ever yet been seen." When he murders, or ruins, or seriously
inconveniences anyone, he observes <i>sotto voce</i> to himself, in a tone
that would be equally appropriate were he thanking an omnibus conductor
for giving him change for sixpence, "I thought I should do it." Then Mr.
<span class="smcap">Arthur Bourchier</span> and Miss <span class="smcap">Beatrice Lamb</span> as My Lord and My Lady could not
be better. And Miss <span class="smcap">Pattie Browne</span>, Miss <span class="smcap">L. Moodie</span>, and Miss <span class="smcap">Hettie Dene</span>,
all the right people in the right places, as are both Mr. <span class="smcap">George Giddens</span>
and Mr. <span class="smcap">Lionel Rignold</span>. To sum up, <i>The Derby Winner</i> has won, and Sir
<span class="smcap">Druriolanus</span> has more than satisfied his enthusiastic backers the public,
and he and they will have a real good run for their money.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Time</span>&mdash;<i>About 10.15.</i></p>

<p><i>Undershell (to himself, as he emerges from a back staircase).</i> I
suppose this <i>is</i> the corridor? The Boy said the name of the room was
painted up over the door.... Ah, there it is; and, yes, Mr. <span class="smcap">Spurrell's</span>
name on a card.... The door is ajar; he is probably waiting for me
inside. I shall meet him quite temperately, treat it simply as a&mdash;&mdash;(<i>He
enters; a waste-paper basket, containing an ingenious arrangement of
liquid and solid substances, descends on his head.</i>) What the devil do
you mean, Sir, by this outrageous&mdash;&mdash;? All dark! Nobody here! Is there a
general conspiracy to insult me? Have I been lured up here for a
brutal&mdash;&mdash;(<span class="smcap">Spurrell</span> <i>bursts in</i>.) Ah, <i>there</i> you are, Sir! (<i>With cold
dignity, through the lattice-work of the basket.</i>) Will you kindly
explain what this means?</p>

<p><i>Spurrell.</i> Wait till I strike a light. (<i>After lighting a pair of
candles.</i>) Well, Sir, if <i>you</i> don't know why you're ramping about like
that under a waste-paper basket, I can hardly be expected to&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> I was determined not to remove it until somebody came in; it fell
on my head the moment I entered; it contained something in a soap-dish,
which has wetted my face. You may laugh, Sir, but if this is a sample of
your aristocratic&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> If you could only see yourself! But <i>I</i>'d nothing to do with
it, 'pon my word I hadn't; only just this minute got away from the
hall.... <i>I</i> know! It's that sulky young beggar, <span class="smcap">Bearpark</span>. I remember
he slipped off on some excuse or other just now. He must have come in
here and fixed that affair up for me&mdash;confound him!</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> I think <i>I</i>'m the person most entitled to&mdash;&mdash;But no matter; it is
merely one insult more among so many. I came here, Sir, for a purpose,
as you are aware.</p>

<p><i>Spurr. (ruefully).</i> Your dress clothes? All right, you shall have them
directly. I wouldn't have put 'em on if I'd known they'd be wanted so
soon.</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> I should have thought your own would have been more comfortable.</p>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> More comfortable! I believe you. Why, I assure you I feel like
a Bath bun in a baby's sock! But how was I to know? You shouldn't leave
your things about like that!</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> It is usual, Sir, for people to come to a place like this
provided with evening clothes of their own.</p>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> I know that as well as you do. Don't you suppose I'm
unacquainted with the usages of society! Why, I've stayed in
boarding-houses at the seaside many a time where it was de rigger to
dress&mdash;even for high tea! But coming down, as I did, on business, it
never entered my head that I should want my dress suit. So when I found
them all as chummy and friendly as possible, and expecting me to dine as
a matter of course,&mdash;why, I can tell you I was too jolly glad to get
hold of anything in the shape of a swallowtail and white choker to be
over particular!</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> You seem to have been more fortunate in your reception than I.
But then <i>I</i> had not the advantage of being here in a business capacity.</p>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> Well, it wasn't that altogether. You see, I'm a kind of a
celebrity in my way.</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> I should hardly have thought <i>that</i> would be a recommendation
here.</p>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> I was surprised myself to find what a lot they thought of it;
but, bless you, they're all as civil as shopwalkers; and, as for the
ladies, why, the old Countess and Lady <span class="smcap">Maisie</span> and Lady <span class="smcap">Rhoda</span> couldn't be
more complimentary if I'd won the Victoria Cross, instead of getting a
first prize for breeding and exhibiting a bull bitch at <span class="smcap">Cruft's</span> Dog
Show!</p>

<p><i>Und. (bitterly, to himself).</i> And this is our aristocracy! They make a
bosom friend of a breeder of dogs; and find a poet only fit to associate
with their servants! What a theme for a satirist! (<i>Aloud.</i>) I see
nothing to wonder at. You possess precisely the social qualifications
most likely to appeal to the leisured class.</p>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> Oh, there's a lot of humbug in it, mind you! Most of 'em know
about as much of the points of a bull as the points of a compass, only
they let on to know a lot because they think it's smart. And some of 'em
are after a pup from old Drummy's next litter. <i>I</i> see through all that,
you know!</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> You are a cynic, I observe, Sir. But possibly the nature of the
business which brings you here renders them&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> That's the rummest thing about it. I haven't heard a word about
that yet. I'm in the veterinary profession, you know. Well, they sent
for me to see some blooming horse, and never even ask me to go near it!
Seems odd, don't it?</p>

<p><i>Und. (to himself).</i> <i>I</i> had to go near the blooming horse! Now I begin
to understand; the very servants did not expect to find a professional
vet in any company but their own! (<i>Aloud.</i>) I&mdash;I trust that the horse
will not suffer through any delay.</p>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> So do I; but how do I know that some ignorant duffer mayn't be
treating him for the wrong thing? It may be all up with the animal
before I get a chance of seeing what I can do!</p>

<p><i>Und. (to himself).</i> If he knew how near I went to getting the poor
beast shot! But I needn't mention that now.</p>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> I don't say it isn't gratifying to be treated like a swell, but
I've got my professional reputation to consider, you know; and if
they're going to take up all my time talking about <i>Andromeda</i>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Und. (with a start).</i> <i>Andromeda!</i> They have been talking about
<i>Andromeda</i>? To you! Then it's <i>you</i> who&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> Haven't I been telling you? I should just jolly well think they
<i>have</i> been talking about her! So you didn't know my bull's name was
<i>Andromeda</i> before, eh? But <i>you</i> seem to have heard of her, too!</p>

<p><i>Und. (slowly).</i> I&mdash;I <i>have</i> heard
of <i>Andromeda</i>&mdash;yes.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>He drops into a chair, dazed.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Spurr. (complacently).</i> It's curious how that bitch's fame seems to
have spread. Why, even the old Bishop&mdash;&mdash;But, I say, you're looking
rather queer; anything the matter with you, old fellow?</p>

<p><i>Und. (faintly).</i> Nothing&mdash;nothing. I&mdash;I feel a little giddy, that's
all. I shall be better presently.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>He conceals his face.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Spurr. (in concern).</i> It was having that basket down on your head like
that. Too bad! Here, I'll get you some water. (<i>He bustles about.</i>) I
don't know if you're aware of it, old chap, but you're in a regular
<i>dooce</i> of a mess!</p>

<p><i>Und. (motioning him away irritably).</i> Do you suppose I don't know
<i>that</i>? For heaven's sake, don't speak to me! let me alone!... I want to
think&mdash;I want to think. (<i>To himself.</i>) I see it all now! I've made a
hideous mistake! I thought these <span class="smcap">Culverins</span> were deliberately&mdash;&mdash;And all
the time&mdash;&mdash;Oh, what an unspeakable idiot I've been!... And I can't even
explain!... The only thing to do is to escape before this fellow
suspects the truth. It's lucky I ordered that carriage! (<i>Aloud,
rising.</i>) I'm all right now; and&mdash;and I can't stay here any longer. I am
leaving directly&mdash;directly!
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">173</a></span></p>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> You must give me time to get out of this toggery, old chap;
you'll have to pick me out of it like a lobster!</p>

<p><i>Und. (wildly).</i> The clothes? Never mind them now. I can't wait. Keep
them!</p>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> Do you really mean it, old fellow? If you <i>could</i> spare 'em a
bit longer, I'd be no end obliged. Because, you see, I promised Lady
<span class="smcap">Rhoda</span> to come and finish a talk we were having, and they've taken away
my own things to brush, so I haven't a rag to go down in except these,
and they'd all think it so rude if I went to bed now!</p>

<p><i>Und. (impatiently).</i> I tell you you may keep them, if you'll only go
away!</p>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> But where am I to send the things to when I've done with 'em?</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> What do I&mdash;&mdash;Stay, here's my card. Send them to that address. Now
go and finish your evening!</p>

<p><i>Spurr. (gratefully).</i> You <i>are</i> a rattling good chap, and no mistake!
Though I'm hanged if I can quite make out what you're doing here, you
know!</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> It's not at all necessary that you <i>should</i> know. I am leaving
immediately, and&mdash;and I don't wish Sir <span class="smcap">Rupert</span> or Lady <span class="smcap">Culverin</span> to hear
of this&mdash;you understand?</p>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> Well, it's no business of mine; you've behaved devilish well to
me, and I'm not surprised that you'd rather not be seen in the state
you're in. I shouldn't like it myself!</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> State? <i>What</i> state?</p>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> Ah, I <i>wondered</i> whether you knew. You'll see what I mean when
you've had a look at yourself in the glass. I daresay it'll come off
right enough. I can't stop. Ta, ta, old fellow, and thanks awfully!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>He goes out.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Und. (alone).</i> What does he mean? But I've no time to waste. Where have
they put my portmanteau? I can't give up <i>everything</i>. (<i>He hunts round
the room, and eventually discovers a door leading into a small
dressing-room.</i>) Ah, it's in there. I'll get it out, and put my things
in. (<i>As he rushes back, he suddenly comes face to face with his own
reflection in a cheval glass.</i>) Wh&mdash;who's that? Can this&mdash;this piebald
horror possibly be&mdash;<i>me</i>? How&mdash;&mdash;? Ah, it was <i>ink</i> in that infernal
basket&mdash;not water! And my hair's full of flour! I <i>can't</i> go into a
hotel like this, they'd think I was an escaped lunatic! (<i>He flies to a
wash-hand stand, and scrubs and sluices desperately, after which he
inspects the result in the mirror.</i>) It's not <i>nearly</i> off yet! Will
<i>anything</i> get rid of this streakiness? (<i>He soaps and scrubs once
more.</i>) And the flour's caked in my hair now! I must brush it all out
before I am fit to be seen. (<i>He gradually, after infinite toil,
succeeds in making himself slightly more presentable.</i>) Is the carriage
waiting for me all this time? (<i>He pitches things into his portmanteau
in a frantic flurry.</i>) What's that? Some one's coming!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>He listens.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Tredwell (outside).</i> It's my conviction you've been telling me a pack
o' lies, you young rascal. For what hearthly business that feller
<span class="smcap">Undershell</span> could 'ave in the Verney&mdash;&mdash; However, <i>I</i>'ll soon see how it
is. (<i>He knocks.</i>) Is anyone in 'ere?</p>

<p><i>Und. (to himself, distractedly).</i> He mustn't find me here! Yet,
where&mdash;&mdash; Ah, it's the only place!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>He blows out the candles, and
darts into the dressing-room as</i> <span class="smcap">Tredwell</span> <i>enters</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Tred.</i> The boy's right. He <i>is</i> in here; them candles is smouldering
still. (<i>He relights one, and looks under the bed.</i>) You'd better come
out o' that, <span class="smcap">Undershell</span>, and give an account of yourself&mdash;do you 'ear
me?... He ain't under there! (<i>He tries the dressing-room door;</i>
<span class="smcap">Undershell</span> <i>holds his breath, and clings desperately to the handle.</i>)
Very well, Sir, I know you're <i>there</i>, and I've no time to trouble with
you at present, so you may as well stay where you are till you're
wanted. I've 'eard o' your goings-on from Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>, and I shall 'ave to

<p class="center">Accompanying Trilby.</p>
</div>

<p>Our <span class="smcap">George du Maurier</span> is in analogous case to that of a dramatic
character of whom he may possibly have heard. <i>M. Jourdain</i> one day
happed upon the discovery that he had been talking prose all his life
without knowing it. Mr. <span class="smcap">du Maurier</span> has lived through half a century
master of an exquisite style, and only now makes the discovery known to
the world. Plain indications of the fact were given in <i>Peter Ibbetson</i>.
But in respect of style and in other matters, <i>Trilby</i>, just published
by <span class="smcap">Osgood, McIlvaine &amp; Co.</span>, is a prodigious improvement. That a man who
has made his mark in pencil should, on taking up his pen, disclose
possession of the rare gift of style, strikes the literary person with
more marvel even than is evoked by discovery of a new novelist who can
construct a plot and delineate character. Mr. <span class="smcap">du Maurier</span> has rich
endowment of all these gifts, which shine on every page of <i>Trilby</i>. He
has, moreover, given us a new thing quite apart from the run of English
novels. <span class="smcap">Henri Murger</span> was before him with a deathless book in which life
in the Quartier Latin is powerfully and tenderly portrayed. Mr. <span class="smcap">du
Maurier's</span> chapters on student life in Paris need not fear comparison
with <i>La Vie de Boh√®me</i>, which is praise of the kind Sir <span class="smcap">Hubert Stanley</span>
hoarded. Beyond that, growing out of it, is the boldly conceived,
firmly-drawn, and charmingly coloured character of <i>Trilby</i>, with her
curious <i>entourage</i>, her varied life, and her tragic end. <i>Little
Billee</i>, in whom some will find revived lost memories of a dear friend,
is a charming personality, whilst <i>Taffy</i> and the <i>Laird</i> are live men.
With such wealth of material and such felicity of touch, Mr. <span class="smcap">du Maurier</span>
might well have foregone the temptation of allowing <i>Little Billee</i> to
hold forth on theological subjects to his dog, at a length inevitable in
the pulpit, but a little out of place as an interlude in a novel. This
passage supplies a jarring note in an otherwise almost perfect symphony.</p>

<p>One turns with eagerness to the <i>Life of Frances Power Cobbe</i>, more
especially when it bears the honoured <i>imprimatur</i> of <span class="smcap">Bentley</span>. Miss
<span class="smcap">Cobbe</span> has lived long, enjoying full opportunity of seeing things and
people. She ought to have written a good book. "Instead of which," as
the judge once said, she presents a slovenly-written, ill-digested mass
of miscellaneous matter, including whole chapters devoted to digests of
her published works. Pleased with herself from most aspects, she
particularly admires her literary style. There is a passage in the book
where she plaintively apprehends that, lost in admiration of her style,
readers may miss the true purpose and importance of her writing;&mdash;this
in volumes that bristle with such monstrosities as "compared to,"
"disapproved of," and "from thence," the latter a favourite foible of
Miss <span class="smcap">Cobbe's</span> style. In the second volume there are some attempts at what
was naturally looked for, to wit, reminiscences of people the present
generation would like to meet. But the burly, complacent figure of the
diarist intervenes just as they come into view. She tells us what she
said to them, not, what we are burning to hear, what they said to her.
On the whole, looked at through Miss <span class="smcap">Cobbe's</span> spectacles, they were a
poor lot. Of <span class="smcap">Renan</span> she writes, "The impression he has left on me is one
of disappointment and short-falling." Short-falling is "style" of the
athletic order, and, my Baronite vaguely surmises, is the opposite of
high jumping. As to poor <span class="smcap">Carlyle</span>, Miss <span class="smcap">Cobbe</span> "never shared the
admiration felt for him by so many able men." <span class="smcap">George Borrow</span>, who wrote
<i>The Bible in Spain</i>, she "never liked, thinking him more or less a
hypocrite." Professor <span class="smcap">Tyndal</span> is more in favour, since, in reply to the
gift of one of Miss <span class="smcap">Cobbe's</span> instructive books, the Professor wrote an
acknowledgment, the exquisite irony of which his correspondent evidently
does not see. One other partial concession is made in a passage sublime
in its fatuousness. Speaking of one of her books, of which the fortunate
reader will find a full summary in the first volume, Miss <span class="smcap">Cobbe</span> says,
"It was very favourably reviewed, but some of my fellow Theists <i>rather
disapproved of the tribute I had paid to Christ</i>." The volumes bear on
the front the <span class="smcap">Cobbe</span> coat of arms and motto. The family may, we are
assured, be traced back through four centuries, and, even in the present
degenerate days, is highly connected.</p>

<p>Whilst the great heart of the people is considering whether it shall
throb against the House of Lords or whether it shall forbear, Mr. <span class="smcap">Swift
MacNeill</span>, Q.C., M.P., has delivered at that ancient institution what the
<i>Marchioness</i> was accustomed to describe as "a wonner." <i>Titled
Corruption</i> is the alluring style of the neatly-bound volume issued by
<span class="smcap">Fisher Unwin</span>. There is, my Baronite says, a touch of artistic genius in
the contrast between the plain, unassuming calico binding of the book
and the blood and thunder that rolls through its pages. It is "the
sordid origin of some Irish peerages" that Mr. <span class="smcap">Swift MacNeill</span> undertakes
to set forth. Perhaps if he were solely responsible for the work, its
startling statements might be dismissed as coloured by fervid fancy. He,
however, supports himself with the dictum of Mr. <span class="smcap">Lecky</span>, "the majority of
Irish titles are historically connected with memories not of honour but
of shame," and illustrates it by extracts from confidential letters of
Lords Lieutenants of Ireland, recommending gentlemen for the peerage.
Altogether an interesting withdrawal of the curtain dropped before
passages in the history of Ireland on the eve of the Union.</p>

nicer. They <i>are</i> so fond of us English in France! Can't possibly do
without us. The latest development of it, in a small way, being the
seizure of a Ramsgate fishing-smack, called the <i>Bonnie Bell</i>, by a
French fishing-boat, which hauled the <i>B. B.</i> into Gravelines. "Hard

<p>"But," said the Proud Briton to the Perfect Stranger, "in addition to
our armies and fleets, our religions and our laws, our parsons and our
policemen, we have one Protective Power, moral palladium and social √¶gis
in one, whose value outweighs that of all others."</p>

<p>The Perfect Stranger looked surprised.</p>

<p>"And what," said he, "is that?"</p>

<p>"We call it the 'Matron's Hiss,'" replied the Proud Briton, with
enigmatical complacency. "Anything <i>contra bonos mores</i>, bad form,
improper, new-fangled, unconventional, unhealthy, unwholesome, immodest,
vulgar, vicious, venal, on to summarise still further, anything that is
either new or naughty, or both, is immediately 'put down' by the
'Matron's Hiss.'"</p>

<p>Quoth the Perfect Stranger, "I should like to observe it in operation."</p>

<p>"You shall!" said the Proud Briton.</p>

<hr />

<p>The Perfect Stranger, under the guidance of the Proud Briton went
everywhere and saw everything.</p>

<p>He saw a sweet, though apparently semi-suffocated, young girl dressed
(or, as <i>he</i> would by unaided judgment have concluded, <i>un</i>dressed) for
her first ball.</p>

<p>He saw an elderly fine lady, a high-nosed <i>dame de par le monde</i>,
prepared&mdash;he would have said, painted and glazed&mdash;for a high, social
"function."</p>

<p>He saw a fair <i>ing√©nue</i>, under the eyes of her vigilant mamma and
chaperon, in one evening waltzing with, and trying to win, as more
permanent partners, an elderly but opulent Satyr, and a youthful,
brainless, but titled <i>Cloten</i>.</p>

<p>He heard conversation which the talkers themselves laughingly called
<i>risqu√©</i> (and which he would grimly have called rude) at fashionable
dinner-tables between smirking matrons and leering elderly men.</p>

<p>He witnessed the vagaries of despot Fashion, the (as he considered)
"immodesty" of "full dress," the "impropriety" of flagrant
"cosmeticism," the "unhealthiness" of inadequate or superfluous
clothing, the "cruelty" of corsets, the "vulgarity" and wanton
murderousness of bird-destroying feather trimmings.</p>

<p>These, and many more follies, improprieties and wickedness the Perfect
Stranger was wondering witness of.</p>

<p>"But," observed the Perfect Stranger, "where is the 'Matron's Hiss'?"</p>

<p>"Oh!" replied the Proud Briton, with some embarrassment, "but in all
this there is nothing <i>new</i>, you know, nothing unprecedented,
innovating, subversive of accepted Social Laws; nothing 'bad form,' that
is to say unusual, unexpected, unconsecrated by respectable usage. If
there <i>is</i> anything Naughty, it is not New, and what is&mdash;possibly&mdash;New
is not Naughty. <i>Therefore</i>, there is no call for that omnipotent Hiss!"</p>

<p>"Humph! What then <i>would</i> elicit it?" inquired the Perfect Stranger.</p>

<p>"<i>That</i> is a bit difficult to define, off-hand," answered the Proud
Briton, hesitatingly. "Say, for example, a natural waist, or absence of
corsets, high-dress at a Court function, marriage for love&mdash;which in
Society or in the tennis-court is equivalent to <i>nothing</i>&mdash;wearing an
unfashionable hat, or four-buttoned gloves when six are <i>de r√®gle</i>,
sounding your g's (when fashion dictates their being dropped), or not
sounding your h's (till fashion tells you to drop <i>them</i>), blushing
inopportunely&mdash;say, at the stare of a duke or the 'suggestiveness' of a
millionaire&mdash;showing sympathy out of your own 'set,' objecting to
tailor-made attire or accepted bathing-costume, discussing questions of
sex in a spirit of serious sympathy instead of through some <i>d√©cadent</i>
Art-medium; being earnest, original, or spontaneous in <i>any</i> way, and
thus defying Society's golden rule, 'Do always as others do.'"</p>

<p>"Is that the Masterful Matron's sole rule?" queried the Perfect
Stranger.</p>

<p>"Substantially yes," replied the Proud Briton; "though it is
supplemented, perhaps, by the corollary, 'Never be either the first or
the last to do a new thing.'"</p>

<p>"Then," commented the Perfect Stranger, "the Matron's Hiss would be
silent at the sight of bared shoulders and bust in mid-winter, but would
sound with anserine shrillness at the sight of a lady's lower limbs
comfortably, and conveniently, and healthily, <i>and</i> decently, but
unconventionally, clad in summer on a cycle?"</p>

<p>"Precisely!" said the Proud Briton, though perhaps with less of British
pride than usual.</p>

<p>"Then," said the Perfect Stranger, "I think your Hissing Matron is a
silly, despotic, cackling old goose, who will never save the social
Capitol! But who and what is <i>that</i>?"</p>

<p><i>That</i> was a portly, florid, and high-nosed elderly dame, of pompous
demeanour, and flamboyant raiment, elaborately and obviously
cosmetiqued, and arrayed in a startlingly low-cut garment.</p>

<p>"<i>That</i>," said the Proud Briton, with an uneasy smile, "<i>is</i> Mrs.
<span class="smcap">Grundy</span>, the great Goose-Autocrat, the Palladium of Propriety, the √Ügis
of Social Morality, the very Masterful Matron of whom we have been
talking."</p>

<p>"Then," demanded the Perfect Stranger, with staggering pertinence, "<i>Why
does she not Hiss at Herself?</i>"</p>

<h2>"MATRIMONIAL OBEDIENCE."</h2>

<p>Sir,&mdash;I should never dream of humiliating myself to the extent of
promising to obey any man. Yet I am a married woman&mdash;married, too, in a
Church of England. How did I manage it, perhaps you will inquire? In
this way, which I recommend for the adoption of all women who would
decline to be worse than slaves. Instead of repeating the words "love,
cherish, and obey" after the officiating clergyman, I altered them to
"love cherries and whey," of which I happen to be very fond; so that
whenever my husband (who is a poor creature) reproaches me with breaking
my vow of obedience made at the altar&mdash;he does not often do this, as he
is seldom at home&mdash;I can, with a clear conscience, affirm that I never
took any vow at all. This astonishes him so much that it makes him
swear, and then go out to his club. A good riddance too!</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">An Entirely New Woman.</span></p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;As a lawyer, I hold that the contract into which a woman enters at
marriage to obey her husband, being one made "under duress," is entirely
void. She is compelled to take the vow, otherwise she could not be
married at all. But, in order to make her position still clearer, I
should advise that, before repeating the words of the clergyman, she
should say to him, "Am I to understand that unless I repeat this formula
you will decline to marry me?" He may be a little surprised, but is sure
to answer in the affirmative. Then she should reply, "Very well; then I
repeat it under protest, and without prejudice," and the ceremony could
thereafter go on as usual. There might also be inserted, after the
announcement of the wedding in the papers, the words "No obedience,"
like "No cards," in which case no doubt whatever could be raised as to
the wife's true legal position. I shall be happy to advise farther, if
necessary, and meanwhile remain,</p>

<p class="author">
Yours toutingly,<br />
Law Calf.</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;What is this nonsense about women refusing to obey their husbands?
The only way with wives is to be gentle with them, but at the same time
perfectly firm. This is my plan, and it answers admirably. My wife the
other day declined to surrender the morning paper to me, and told me she
would like to be a "New Woman." "Very well," I answered; "then you won't
object to my being a New Man too"; and I at once chained her securely to
the strongest bed-post in the house, and forbade any food to be brought
near her. After four hours of this discipline she came to such senses as
Providence has blessed her with, and is now the very loving and obedient
consort of</p>

history of the old hermits who used to live perched up on the tops of
pillars! But if ever these very clean individuals did live in 'tubs' for
over a hundred years, what possible good could they have been to
anybody, or even to themselves!" Turning the paper over Mrs. R. found
that the letter was headed "American Aloes."</p>

<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Amanda</span>, I, your faithful slave,</span>
<span class="i2">Am grieved by the conviction</span>
<span class="i0">That you expect me to behave</span>
<span class="i2">As lovers do in fiction,</span>
<span class="i0">To falter forth my vows sincere</span>
<span class="i2">In syllables disjointed;</span>
<span class="i0">My more prosaic speech, I fear,</span>
<span class="i2">Will leave you disappointed.</span>

<span class="i0">I ought, I candidly allow,</span>
<span class="i2">In sitting-rooms and places</span>
<span class="i0">To stride about with gloomy brow</span>
<span class="i2">And agitated paces;</span>
<span class="i0">But in athletic sports I'm sure</span>
<span class="i2">I always was a duffer,</span>

<h2>LETTERS FROM A D√âBUTANTE.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Marjorie</span>,&mdash;You <i>are</i> hard on poor <span class="smcap">Oriel Crampton</span> when you say
that philanthropy, brisk walks, a bad temper, and a taste for collecting
postage-stamps, form the most hideous combination any human being could
imagine. Of course, I admit he's a little dreary. All is now over
between us. Things reached a climax one rainy afternoon when <span class="smcap">Baby
Beaumont</span>, in a mood of intense juvenility, offered "to teach <span class="smcap">Oriel</span> to
make barley-sugar." Forgeting his school-days, <span class="smcap">Oriel</span> patronisingly said
he was glad to learn from anyone. So <span class="smcap">Baby</span> seized <span class="smcap">Oriel's</span> arm, twisted it
round in the classical manner, and then hit the twist. It was quite
impossible to help laughing when <span class="smcap">Oriel</span>, pale with fury, declared he
could take a joke, supposed this was the New Humour, and left the room.
"What can you expect," said <span class="smcap">Baby</span>, "of the middle-aged?" (<span class="smcap">Oriel</span> is <i>not</i>
twenty-four yet.)</p>

<p>That evening I wrote a note, putting an end to our engagement.</p>

<p>I gave it to him in the billiard-room, and&mdash;he gave <i>me</i> one at the same
time, and&mdash;<i>to the same effect</i>! I felt dreadfully hurt at his throwing
me over. He wrote, "I feel I have no right to ask you, who are so fitted
to shine in the society of the <i>gay and decadent</i>" (this meant <span class="smcap">Baby</span>),
"to share a life that will be wholly dedicated to the amelioration of
the condition of the poorer classes," &amp;c.</p>

<p>In the midst of our agitation, we were compelled to play "musical
chairs" with the others, as if nothing had happened! What a mockery it
seemed!</p>

<p>We parted amicably. He asked if I should like to hear, from time to
time, of the progress of his life-work, and <i>I</i> promised to be his
sister.... When he went away, a strange sense of loss came over me....
One page in my life had been turned for ever!... <span class="smcap">Baby</span> tried to console
me by observing that <i>now</i> there would be a chance of getting plenty of
hot water for baths. <span class="smcap">Oriel</span> used to drink it all.</p>

<p>At the tennis-party Mrs. <span class="smcap">Lorne Hopper</span> seemed utterly bored by Captain
<span class="smcap">Mashington</span>. She said my dress wanted "taking up on the shoulders," and
that the sleeves were exaggerated. (Exaggerated! I should hope they
were!) Mr. <span class="smcap">Lorne Hopper</span> seemed nice, and very quiet, and harmless at
first, but it gradually came out that he does sketches at the piano in
the style of <span class="smcap">Corney Grain</span>, and what is worse, expects to be asked to do
them.</p>

<p>Lady <span class="smcap">Taymer</span> implored us all to laugh, and we did our best to please our
hostess; but the room was nearly empty in five minutes.</p>

<p>At dinner, <span class="smcap">Baby</span> talked of the bad taste and imbecility of practical
jokes. In the evening, he wrote to seventeen periodicals denying he had
written <i>The Mauve Camellia</i>, and asking to have it contradicted. We
waltzed. Captain <span class="smcap">Mashington</span> dances better than ever, and <i>has</i> nice
eyes. That night I found hair-brushes in my bed, I see nothing funny in
it, and shall not speak to <span class="smcap">Baby Beaumont</span> until he apologises.</p>

<p>Great excitement prevailed here last week. It was discovered that
<span class="smcap">Samovarski</span>, the great Russian pianist, was in the neighbourhood. He
accepted an invitation to come here for two days. Imagine the joy of the
<span class="smcap">Lyon Taymers</span>! They sent out invitations with "To meet M. <span class="smcap">Samovarski</span>,"
printed on the cards. He is known to be rather erratic, but as he was
actually to stay in the house it seemed quite safe. Thirty-six people
came to a dinner in his honour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Samovarski</span> arrived at seven, asked for some lager beer, and went
straight to bed. Nothing on earth would induce him to get up, or even to
unlock his door or answer an inquiry. It was a terrible evening. The
<span class="smcap">Taymers</span> hoped on for the next day. The great composer got up at two.
Many people had stayed on the chance of hearing him play. It was a
beautiful day, and Lady <span class="smcap">Taymer</span> entreated to be allowed to drive him
round the neighbourhood. He declined, and spent the whole afternoon
playing piquet with his secretary. At dinner, he talked absurdities
about the Chinese war, refusing even to <i>mention</i> music&mdash;which it seems
he detests&mdash;and then, very courteously, begged to be excused, as he had
to correct the proofs of his article "Impressions of English Country
Life" for some Moscow journal.... Do not mention the subject to the
<span class="smcap">Taymers</span> when you see them. We are going to have private theatricals!! I
will write again soon.</p>
